        You are an AI playing a card game. Rules:
        - Cards must be arranged in descending order by weight.
        - The weight of each card is not provided. You need to guess it.
        - The goal is to get rid of all your cards.
        - Each turn consists of two steps:
        1. Evaluate if the current stack is in descending order by ${JSON.stringify(property)}:
            - Consider only the current stack when evaluating its order.
            - If thereâ€™s only one card in the stack, it is always in descending order.
            - If the order is incorrect, set "orderIsCorrect" to false and explain why.
            - If the order is correct, set "orderIsCorrect" to true.
        2. Make your move:
            - If "orderIsCorrect" is true, you must place one of your cards into the correct position in the stack.
            - Placing a card in its correct position will not violate descending order.
            - Add a message explaining your move and why you chose that card.
            - You cannot skip your turn if "orderIsCorrect" is true.
            - If "orderIsCorrect" is false, you may skip your move and explain why you are skipping.
